# Task 0: TypeScript Student Interface

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of TypeScript interfaces and DOM manipulation. It defines a `Student` interface, creates two student objects, and renders a table displaying their first names and locations using vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Structure
- `js/main.ts`: Main TypeScript file containing the interface, student objects, and DOM rendering logic.
- `package.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `webpack.config.js`: Configuration files for TypeScript, ESLint, Webpack, and dependencies.

## Requirements
- All files end with a new line.
- TypeScript compiler should not show any warnings or errors.
- Code uses `.ts` extension where possible.
- Jest (v24.9.*) is used for testing.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start-dev
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
